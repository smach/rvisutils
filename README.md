rvisutils
=========

This package is currently still in its very early stages. It will become a collection of visualization functions that I've found useful over the years.

To install, you will need to have the devtools package on your system (if you don't have it, install that with install.packages("devtools")) and then run

``` r

devtools::install_github("smach/rvisutils.R")
```

To get a full listing of available functions and links to their help files, run

``` r

help(package="rvisutils")
```
